  # You can group stages into individual workflows

#  # You can add custom github actions configurations to run after completion
#  # of all other jobs here. This accepts normal github job config except that
#  # the `needs` config is filled in for you, and you aren't allowed to pass it.
#  on_completion:
#    # Example job that pings a web hook url stored in a github secret with a
#    # json payload linking to the failed run.
